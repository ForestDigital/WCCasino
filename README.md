#Research Abstract
##Problem and motivation
Seeking the thrills and entertainment of participating in the lottery or going to the store to buy scratch cards is tedious and time consuming. Due to health concerns, the fun of a casino might be too difficult to travel to. Luckily, the Internet provides a great medium to bring this kind of environment to the personal computer.

Winners Circle Casino aims to provide the entertainment from a real casino, into a personalized environment of the user's choosing. With 3 different games to choose from, and a customizable user profile page, players can sit back at home or work and still be able to enjoy the fun of a casino!

##Background
Winners Circle Casino attempts to recreate a similar casino site from the MMO game EVE Online called iwantisk.com. On this site there are multiple games and an imaginary currency called 'isk'. Players participate in the luck based games like slots or scratchcards, and compete in the more competitive games like Raffles.
